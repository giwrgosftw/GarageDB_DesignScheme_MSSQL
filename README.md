# Garage System DB Schema
This repository represents the DB structure of a single-page web application designed for managing vehicle information within a garage system. Employees utilize this app to input data for each vehicle brought in for repairs or servicing.

However, the application is actually an extensive form that the employee fills out during the process. This form encompasses various and huge amount of detail about the vehicle. The goal of the project was to ensure efficient data management and adhere to best practices. So, the test was to organize the information across multiple database tables, leveraging the normalization technique to an optimal level.

Included within the repository is a comprehensive system diagram (image) outlining the structure and relationships of the database tables. Additionally, the repository provides all the necessary CRUD SQL scripts for consistent integration and management of the application's data.

This project serves as a showcase of my expertise in database management, relationship modeling, and MS SQL, demonstrating the ability to design and implement robust solutions for complex data management scenarios.
